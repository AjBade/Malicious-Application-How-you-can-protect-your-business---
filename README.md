A malicious application, also known as malware, is software that is intentionally designed to harm or exploit a computer system. This can include viruses, Trojans, spyware, adware, and ransomware. Malware can compromise sensitive information, damage systems, and spread to other devices.

	• What Are Malicious Applications? 
	
	-> Malware refers to hostile program code used to corrupt or misuse system .
	
	-> Malware depends on it’s purpose & the network layout .
	
	-> Malicious App of software or code designed for nefarious(Wrong intension) goal .
	
	-> Purpose has to intentionally damaging assets .
	
	-> This technology has evolved to evade detection. Malicious apps resort to tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) to dodge recognition and, in some instances, masquerade themselves as legitimate and harmless apps. This method is called obfuscation and is a vital trait of these programs. Furthermore, its adaptable nature comes from the need to survive the developments in cybersecurity.
	
	-> So, a malicious app infiltrates your device and network by extension. It harms, eavesdrops, collects information, and softens your system’s defenses.
	
	• Risky Vs. Malicious Applications
	
	-> There is a distinction you need to make between a malicious application and a risky one. 
	
	-> The former aims to harm and inflict damage on your systems .
	
	-> The latter, however, are not inherently faulty, but certain enterprises would find them an operational risk due to the entities’ risk tolerance.
	
	• Malicious Applications and Your Business
	
	Malware is detrimental to you as a person and as a business owner. Malicious applications can:
	
		○ Interrupts and disables services: Malware can break networks, thus disrupting business operations. Not to mention, they can disable essential services that your company offers. In turn, it completely breaks down the network infrastructure.
		
		○ Retrieves and spoofs personal information : malicious applications can collect your data through emails or downloads. Once the malware acquires your personal information, it will cease control of your system operations. Not only can it send spam emails on your behalf, but it poses a threat to banks as their transactions are primarily online.
		
		○ Controls All Applications on Your Device: Through your personal information, malicious applications cease control over all applications on your device.
		
		○ Access Sensitive Information: The malware has access to the server machine. Subsequently, it will access sensitive business information. In some cases, the malware will result in hardware damage.

	• How You Can Avoid Malicious Applications
         
     Prevention is ultimately better than cure in this case.

	- In General 
	
	○ App Store reviews and strange app descriptions: A legitimate app will have a grammatically correct and concise description. Furthermore, a genuine app will have a lot of reviews and ratings from users. A good rule of thumb here is: if an app has been downloaded and then reviewed by thousands, chances are it is legit.
	
	○ Checkmark: As with many platforms  app stores have a list of verified developers. These developers have a checkmark by their names.
	
	○ Exercise extreme diligence with mobiles: Mobiles are more vulnerable than other devices. Keep that in mind when conducting business through your phone. Remember, mobile browsers cannot recognize and combat malicious applications efficiently.
	
	○ Official app stores: Exclusively install applications from official app stores such as Google Play. In the case of the Amazon App Store, install it either from the app itself or the official website.
	
	○ Security Patches: Ensure the operating systems and apps are updated on their security patches as malicious applications take advantage of such vulnerabilities.

	- Business Wise 
	
	○ Regular Cybersecurity Training: Employers should provide such training so employees can identify malware and other security threats. The training does not have to be fancy. Teaching people to be aware and cautious with unsolicited communications is good enough.
	
	○ Trained IT department: Having an IT department trained in cybersecurity will guarantee your business’s safety.
	
	○ Different levels of privileges: Every employee would have as much access as necessary for them to do their job. If someone were to access a level, they would not be able to access the whole network.
	
	- If you suspect the presence of the malware:
	
	○ Unusual data usage: Malicious apps run in the background on your device. They often rely on your data to work. So, if your data usage is increasing and you cannot attribute this increase to anything, malware might be the culprit. Temporarily cap your data usage to prevent these apps from performing tasks and communicating in the background until you can identify and uninstall them.
	
	○ HIRE A PROFESSIONAL: I cannot stress this enough. If your business is under threat, the wisest thing you can do as a business owner is to pay for a professional to fix it. They know what they are doing, and they are a good investment.
